Twenty five years have elapsed for us since the sadly nostalgic, winebibbing Londo Mollari first announced the dawn of the Third Age. In doing so, the ambassador teased the sincerely though bombastically portrayed concepts that combined uniquely within *Babylon 5* to brew the most relevant contemporary myth-parable fully native to pop culture entertainment. Depicting a future full of the familiar angst of power dynamics, *The Gathering* shows the first stirrings of fellowship and the cessation of shallow ambitions and fears at the revelation of mystery. Very much a faithful representation of what was to come after it in the regular episodes, *The Gathering* reached far and wide -- through worldbuilding to the synthesis of mythology, through eclectic genre conventions to hard science, through politics to contemporary social dynamics -- in order to leave an assembly brimming with the potential to express camaraderie, mystery, and catharsis. If in 2018 the critic might dismiss this brew as being garish or stale, tasters with less discriminating tongues will find the well-aged blend to be an enriching and stimulating draught.

Specifically, this blend of thematic source material revolves around a *who done it* plot that depicts the fear of other people in our system of politics, negotiation, and power structures. The setting and the namesake of the franchise is a distilled microcosm of contemporary society, its name -- *Babylon 5* -- referencing the ancient city of exile, tyranny, and multicultural ambiguity in the Bible. Also serving as a public port for all kinds of purposes mundane and nefarious, the station's primary purpose is to host some sort of ongoing "United Nations" peace conference between Earth and the other powers of the galaxy. (Dialog between two leading characters explicitly makes the comparison to "the UN on earth / Before it was dissolved.") Despite the station's high-minded pacifistic purpose, the gathering is broken before it is fully assembled, when an unknown assasin poisons and nearly kills the ambassador from the most enigmatic and powerful alien civilization, the Vorlon Empire.

The opening act depicts the station's ranking officer Commander Jeffrey Sinclair showing and telling the newly arrived station crew member and audience stand-in Lyta Alexander, while Executive Officer Laurel Takashima and the nameless, traditionally uniformed personnel in Babylon Control build up the significance of the impending arrival of the Vorlon ambassador. When Ambassador Kosh does arrive -- early, catching the eclectic little station off guard -- he is immediately set up as a *dying god*. The mysterious representative from an indeterminately powerful civilization -- veiled from human site by a full body suit that can only be concealing a very alien form -- is shown stepping off his ship and into the chamber where the other ambassadors were supposed to greet him, and then the next thing we know, he is lying belly-up on the floor like some discarded plastic action figure.

This is a fascinating stroke of both plotting and characterization. Perhaps the most immediately practical consequence is that it allows us to sympathize with Kosh -- a character that is not portrayed by an actor but is basically a mechanical puppet. Asking the audience to buy in to Kosh as a serious, semi-mythological figure of indeterminate powers might have been a hard sell, but both his believability as a character capable of audience empathy and eventually his seriousness as a powerful being in the show's legendarium are carefully shielded by *The Gathering*'s calculated pacing. We see Kosh get out of his ship, and before we can move from feelings of alienness and weirdness to thinking that it might all be a bit ridiculous, we see him lying ridiculously on the floor. But then we hear that he has been poisoned in an attempted assassination, and the ridiculousness turns to pity -- we can't be laughing at the posture of a murder victim, after all.

The unfolding plot relies on the rigidly followed convention of dutiful officers breaking the rules in order to do the right thing or to ultimately fulfill their real mission, being willing to take "full responsibility" for their actions in dignified professional sacrifice. Familiar from about one out of every two *Star Trek* episodes ever made, this convention serves little more than to move the plot forward, or perhaps also to establish a few genre and character expectations. Ultimately, *Babylon 5* does share with *Star Trek* some of the imagery of the dutiful, virtuous human space officer as the exemplorary progressive human. As a massive generalization with notable counter-points in both cases, both the aesthetics and the narratives of both of these space opera franchises are optimistic and progressive. However, *Babylon 5* does not follow *Star Trek* in identifying progress with utopianism or scientific materialism. Where *Star Trek* is utopian, *Babylon 5* is transcendental.

Here in *The Gathering*, this different emphasis on humanistic progress manifests in the political realism. *Babylon 5* is all about politics; interstellar politics is the whole reason the station exists, and the show extends the political interconnectedness through its depiction of its characters' relationships to each other through their institutions. More than in most other science fiction television -- easily more than in *Babylon 5*'s obvious genre predecessors -- politics is brutally personal. In one scene, a politician speaking by video conference to Commander Sinclair asks who is in charge of the investigation regarding the apparent assassination attempt, and then bluntly questions Security Chief Michael Garibaldi's competence in light of Garibaldi's past professional failures. Garibaldi was in the room for that conversation, setting up the sense of social fear fueled by political anxiety that carries *The Gathering* and that the franchise would later excel in evoking.

Our guide through this familiarly alien future of politics colliding with social and professional strife is the business casual newcomer Lyta Alexander. Or, more accurately, our guide is Commander Sinclair as he shows Lyta around the station; for we are Lyta Alexander. Her portrayal by Patricia Tallman suggests an average, generically Western professional woman from the '90s. Her occasionally sarcastic, often disconcerted manner is probably the strongest acting in the movie. All of this makes Lyta an ideal audience representative, our questions in her mouth as we along with her are instructed in the ways and circumstances of *Babylon 5*.

> "One last thing, Commander. Why is it called *Babylon 5*?"
> "*Baylon*&rsquo;s 1, 2, and 3 were sabotaged and destroyed. Number 4 vanished without a trace 24 hours after becoming operational. To this day, no one knows what happened to it."
> "Swell."
> -- Lyta Alexander to Commander Jeffrey Sinclair, timestamp 08:30

But Lyta is a telepath. Having the audience stand-in character embody the aspect of the worldbuilding that is potentially the most difficult to buy into is a stroke of both wish-fulfillment

We hear about the "Third Age," using the convention of sequential ages demarcated by cataclysmic events found in multiple epic fantasy franchises. *The Lord of the Rings* is set in its universe's Third Age, and *Babylon 5*'s creator J. Michael Straczynski is not the only author to have used similar nomenclature to evoke the dramatic grandeur and archetypal imagery that have grown beyond the genre boundary of high mythological fantasy. Tolkien's influence is yet to be revealed in its strongest manifestations, but here in the pilot film we are already staring backward at the legacies of decadent civilizations and hearing the evening lament of ancient races diminishing into the twilight as younger kindreds with incompatible destinies rise to replace them.

As science fiction, *The Gathering* lays out some of the ecclectic qualities that that make *Babylon 5* impossible to measure on the "hard" to "soft" scale of scientific accuracy and realistic future possibility. However, *The Gathering* perhaps shows off the franchise's *harder* side more, leaving the more mystical elements to be intertwined with the science by coming episodes to be suggested by the mythological imagery. The one explictly *soft* element highlighted by *The Gathering*. The existence and social prevalence of human telepaths is easily the most difficult aspect of the setting to buy into, and here they easily play into the pervasive comic book vibe. But the aesthetic is not only composed of that "campy" self-conscious energy; it is also made up of an advanced realism informed by the harder sci-fi elements. Artificial gravity is produced by the centrifugal force generated by rotating sections of the station, and humans have to wear gas masks in order to pass through areas of the station prepared for creatures that breathe air of alien composition. Where *Star Trek* plays fast and loose with the concept of futuristic technology and relies on "technobabble" for a veneer of fake detail designed to conceal the fact that the technology has no substance, *Babylon 5* takes the higher ground of carefully portraying the interactions between technology and the characters and setting, using technobabble inconspicuously and sparingly.

> The tactfully employed technobabble implicates another science fiction sub-genre that stands alongside space opera as a major classification for *Babylon 5* and *The Gathering* -- cyberpunk, the genre of fictional gadgetry and imaginative interfacing between people and machines. *The Gathering* portrays bio-implanted weaponry and a personal espionage device, one appearing in a momentary surfacing of the cyberpunk vein, the other serving a critical part of the plot and bridging the deeper aspects of the backstory and world with the political story sub-plot.

The feeling associated with the cyberpunk elements is also built up by the appearance and operation of the common everyday technologies that the characters use. *The Gathering* features identification cards that interface with terminals to display the carrier's identifying information. That one realistic application of understandable technologies lends a sense of timelessness. Something like it could have been implemented in 1993; today in 2018 we almost expect it to exist.

Not only is the concept of the identicards understandable, but the design of the terminal display -- shown prominently as a plot and character development device -- has aged remarkably well, the font reminiscient of alarm clock numerals notwithstanding. Granted, the DOS-like output looks timelessly old (though we've seen the return of the command line to the popular consciousness in the past ten years or so), and at any rate other tech seen in *The Gathering* now looks definitively retro -- curved CRT monitors, for a chief example. This is a *retro* old, an outdatedness that blends with the decade reflecting hairstyles and the oldschool geek spaceships and control consoles and campy sci-fi miscellany. The special effects have aged at least as poorly as the CRT monitors, with the computer rendered exterior space frames and the title graphics being glaringly crude and surreal today. 

Perhaps we can't definitively identifying which parts of the retro aesthetic were once inherent and which are only now so interpreted. Like a familiar pair of leather boots or a baseball mitt, the campy retro aesthetic has worn in over time. Contemporary audience members already familiar either with genre conventions or with the now popular 80's revivalism should be able to view *The Gathering* as the earnest mythological story that it is without its seriousness being compromized by its aesthetic.

The retro aesthetic combines with the cyberpunk to craft the setting into a bridge that unites the viewers' present world with the mystery and adventure found in the genre elements. Naturally, cyberpunk is the science fiction sub-genre that we recognize from everyday life in our 21st century. The sub-genre best serves not as a projection of possible tomorrows but as an actualization of potential todays. In *The Gathering*, the espionage plot serves alongside background dialog to deliver what will become one of the primary story elements of *Babylon 5* -- politics. Twentieth century political narratives are both explictly named and referenced. There is both a direct continuity to the modern histories that we remember in the show's backstory chronology and strongly implied parallels between the sociopolitical situation between the galactic civilizations and the Cold War era politics during which *The Gathering* was created.

The world portrayed in *The Gathering* feels like a real world, and it feels like *our* world. That world is *Babylon 5*, the space station. Named in the likeness of the biblical Babylon -- a place of sin and captivity and political oppression and intercultural ambiguity in the Old Testament -- this Babylon serves as a stage where great mythological narratives and sweeping political machinations intersect with the stories of common people both sympathetic and and apalling, both familiar and alien, both powerful and weak, both evil and righteous. Of course, the point of the space opera backdrop is that the setting is not just one boring little world, it's a cosmos full of many worlds, and worlds yet to be discovered. We are gathered in to consider the great themes of our histories and cultures from a platform as small and cluttered and chaotic as the Babylon that we know.

This is how the intricately constructed setting and grandiose thematic overtones are all directed toward the people whose paths lie through this little Babylon. Perhaps more than its rival space opera franchises *Star Trek* and *Star Wars*, *Babylon 5* is stabilized by its characters. *Star Trek* can reach for strange new worlds to cover for a dearth of character building; and in *Star Wars* the mythology is central, with character being subservient to mythology. Though *Babylon 5* could never be complete without its setting or its mythology -- indeed, the space station is a character in its own right, while the monomyth template applies to certain of its characters almost as strongly as to Luke Skywalker -- the structure and aesthetic of the franchise seems to direct all other concerns toward the characters.

One scene in which Lyta mediates a business transaction and then is belligerently confronted by the businessman whose dishonesty she exposed feels like a distillation of the contemporary acknowledgment of the plight of professional women abused by powerful institutional men. "Someday I'm going to find the guy who thought up the idea of renting telepaths to businessmen, and I'm going to kill him," the man says to Lyta, treating her explicitly like property and setting up the experience of the institutional telepath in this imagined future to be parallel to the experience of the corporate woman -- the telepath is consider special, somewhat alien, expected to be aloof and to serve her purpose, but is regarded as property, never a proactive party to the dealings that she helps facilitate. The very next sequence in *The Gathering* shows Lyta being sexually propositioned by the Narn ambassador G'Kar, though stylistically the effect seems to be played for an awkward laugh at Lyta's discomfort.

One modern reading of Lyta's role in the plot is that she could represent for us the situation of the woman struggling for justice in the face of an institutional culture that could destroy her professionally should she come forward.

{ And inhabiting this political world/story are these characters..... }

    { -> Lyta Alexander }
    { -> Carolyn Sykes }
Other than teasing that Carolyn might have been the assasin, { Carolyn does nothing but wait around in Sinclair's bed }.
    { -> Jeffrey Sinclair }
The plot makes it clear to the viewer that he's not actually the assasin.
    { -> Carolyn Sykes }
    { -> Laurel Takashima }
The first officer of *Babylon 5* is best characterized by the scene set in her quarters, where her mild rule breaking becomes part of a secondary theme of the plot.

    { -> Michael Garibaldi }
    { -> Delenn }
    { -> G'Kar }
        { -> The other "Shapeshifter" }
    { -> Londo }
    { -> Kosh }
From the moment of his appearance, Kosh is set up as a dying god. { sypathy increased by having him incapacitated -- needed to sympathize with an animontronics thing that doesn't look human }

Sinclair and Lyta are the two protagonists. In both cases, we are shown that the indictments against them are incorrect. { They fight against the prejudices of the court drama. }

Three of the primary characters of *The Gathering* will not return for the first standard episode *Midnight on the Firing Line*. One of those will yet be involved in the rebirth of the mysteries merely suggested here.

{ Tie in plot about institutional corruption and false accusation and witness blaming.}
{ Mention worldbuilding and mythology one more time. }
One thing sure -- this cup will not pass from us until we drink it down to the dregs.
