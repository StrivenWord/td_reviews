_1.            Above-the-fold intro.
1.1.          Attention step sentence_
The year 2019 saw the outbreak of disease leading to widespread social unrest in Europe.
**¶**

_1.2.          First full paragraph about main thesis: Plague tale is good because it's a mature game written from the perspective of childhood innocense that honors family without being family friendly_
_1.2.1.        First sentence mentioning title. (Mentioning Steam Award is unnecessary.)_
_1.2.1.1.      Secondary clause of this sentence indiciating what to introduce the game as._
I'm referring to *A Plague Tale: Innocence*, last year's historical adventure game that won top honors for narrative achievement even as its praiseworthy young characters won the hearts of an adoring fanbase on Xbox One, Playstation 4, and personal computer.
**¶**


_1.2.2.        Thesis setence(s)._
Launched one year before Coronavirus reset many of our expectations, *A Plague Tale* has been inspirational beyond its modest goals and its linear story due to its expectation shattering aesthetic: its appealing use of the values associated with childhood without being in the least "family friendly."
_1.2.3.        One or more sentences introducing and naming Amicia and Hugo._
_1.2.4.        Last sentence of first paragraph teasing all the things that *A Plague Tale* is._
Achieved by its linear narrative structure oriented around the perspectives of its lead characters, *A Plague Tale* puts the vindicated resourcefulness of youth in an intense quest not only for the survival of the young heroes, but also for the preservation of their parents' legacy, their family history, and the tested wisdom of old age. Amicia of House De Rune, a fifteen-year-old noblewoman and the primary player character, must protect her five-year-old brother Hugo from being kidnapped by the Inquisition for mysterious reasons while fighting off hordes of supernaturally aggressive man-eating rats. A largely historical game set in 1348, one year after the rat-borne black death arrived in its milieu of southwestern France, *A Plague Tale* uses engaging, traditionally fun gameplay alongside its artistic and gently personal narrative structure to bridge the gap between broken adulthood and unspoiled childhood.
**¶**

_1.3.          Brief pararaph (possibly only once sentence) about Coronavirus and the connection to the present._
_1.4.          Hook paragraph: Emotional Rewards/Experience_
_1.4.1.        Introduction linking last year (when the game came out) to the present._
Along the way, Amicia and Hugo encounter eerie parallels to our current daily experience: rumors of an encroaching illness spreading through the land, causing social unrest leading to and an atmosphere of distrust while the political pot begins to boil over. The fact that this game was released precisely one year before the thick of the Coronavirus concern is a stroke of fate that has extended the game's relevance and fame. However, the experience of playing the game and enjoying it communally with its fanbase was no less satisfying in 2019, when its emotionally rewarding sense of moral vindication carried it through to nominations and awards for narrative achievement and historical design.
**¶**

_1.4.2.        Sentences listing/enumerating emotional rewards._
_1.4.2.1.      First, the purely mechanical or least erudite or most gamerish kinds of rewards (since more idealogical rewards have already been teased)._
_1.4.2.2.      Final emotional reward in the list related to its historical interest._
Considered as a videogame, the game's engagement unfolds through its stealth action control design, its strategic and puzzle-solving adventure-genre characteristics, and the feeling of acceleration incited by the story's narrative guiding, which pushes the players along through the chapters without calling attention to the boundaries of the implemented world. Considering *A Plague Tale* as a videogame is crucial, as its tightly disciplined implementation of its feature set and its beautifully rendered world sustain its thematic vision of an interactive medieval Europe portrayed from within its own medieval worldview, complete with alchemy, pseudoscience, and all kinds of religious ideas and institutions in a landscape full of beauty and depth but also terror and decay.

_1.5.          Brief transition paragraph explaining why we are beginning with a discussion of setting/milieu and in-game story-world environment. (This will be only one sentence and may actually be immediately below the fold instead of above it.)_
In order to understand how this game sustains its higher theme about the perseverance of innocence, the intricacies medieval milieu should be examined.

_2.            Milieu
2.1.          Description of emotional awards relevant to the fact that the game is set in the Middle Ages._
_2.1.1.        Potentially a reference to other media, i.e. *The Lord of the Rings*._
Part of the fun involved in playing *A Plague Tale* comes from the genre conventions of its setting, knights and castles, armor and ruins. Leveraging those conventions into an authentic spirit involves expressing embodying a medieval ethos in some way. *A Plague Tale* accomplishes this by depicting its historical detail from its characters' own medieval worldview, showing the fear and the social disturbances of the 14th-century pandemic in a way that feels authentically medieval. For instance, rats are materially the source of the plague in *A Plague Tale*, a departure from scientific accuracy that likely mirrors the way that medieval people understood and experienced the plague. The existence of the plague as a disease is more-or-less irrelevant background detail in *A Plague Tale*, which feels like a bit of an oversight, though there are depictions both of the social unrest caused by widespread death due to disease and even of infected individuals themselves. The medieval experience comes through in the mystical and low fantasy elements derived from the characters' medieval philosophy surrounding the rats and the plague, constructing a world that feels true to the way that medieval people might have experienced the plague based on their own expectations.

**[Screenshot goes here.]**

_2.1.2.        Description of all the ways that *A Plague Tale* pleases players who love the Middle Ages._
_2.1.2.1.      Knights, castles etc. -- also, mention the Inquisition here._
In the province of Aquitaine in Southwestern France, heavily armed soldiers brutally impose a martial quarantine upon the common folk, beneath the banner of a nonstandard double-barred cross. Their order is known only as "the Inquisition," a fascist military society with a religious interest in the mysterious disease. With the Hundred Year's War raging between occupying armies, Amicia and Hugo find themselves fleeing through battleground hellscapes and wading through corpses in imagery evoking the dark brutality of traditional folktales in their raw and unmodernized form.
**¶**

_2.2.          Historicity of the setting in Southwestern France (Aquitaine)_
_2.2.1.        Reddit quote from Sébastien Renard: "As we're French, living in a city with a rich and heavy past, we walk all day long in the shadow of medieval monuments, so it helps imagine the way villages and cities were built, what the countryside looked like, etc."_
_2.2.1.1.      Brief clause or phrase teasing introduction to Asobo Studio._


The fantastic and the historical are united in this vivid setting through an abiding sense of authenticity. This authenticity is perhaps borne of the close relationship between the developers and the land, for the game development company Asobo Studio is based out of the city of Bordeaux in the very locale where their game is set. Narrative designer Sébastien Renard commented on Reddit regarding the creative inspiration for the setting, "As we're French, living in a city with a rich and heavy past, we walk all day long in the shadow of medieval monuments, so it helps imagine the way villages and cities were built, what the countryside looked like, etc."
**¶**

_2.2.2.        Historical overview of the Black Death._
_2.2.2.1.      Asobo's modification of the concept of the Plague._
_2.2.3.        Mechanic of history objects in the Inventory._
Its historicity is one of *A Plague Tale*'s main attractions, being explicitly featured in one of the game's secondary mechanics. Several types of objects, unnecessary for completing the chapters, are found often in out-of-the-way places. When discovered, these items are added to the Inventory menu, where informational dialogs are displayed along with the 3d artwork for each object, explaining its historical significance. These come in three different categories -- "Curiosities" for everyday objects that illustrate medieval life, "Gifts" for knick-knacks that the children find during the course of the game, and "Hugo's Herbarium" for flowers, which when discovered prompt Hugo to pick the flower from the ground and place it in his sister's hair.
**[Screenshot of Hugo putting the flower into Amicia's hair]**


_2.2.3.1.      The rosary object._
The easter-egg objects are not needed to advance through to the end of the game, and the act of checking the inventory to read the historical anecdotes is one of the very few activities that pull the player out of the game world in what is otherwise an exceedingly immersive game. That being said, the easter-egg objects and the historical objects work together to create a profound sense of place reverberating through both the internal context of the story world and the surrounding context within history. For example, in a meticulously and hauntingly rendered interior of a large, austere church a simple fourteenth-century rosary can be found. That church, and the sequence of interactions that can occur within it, marks one of the groundbreaking characterization sequences in the game, as Amicia staggers through the shock of having been forced to kill in self-defense while the siblings mourn for their parents. This demonstrates why *A Plague Tale* cannot be classified as simply an erudite version of a typical hardcore action-adventure game. A typical mainstream game might have deep historical and artistic merit, but such a game would be expected to use its intricate milieu for aesthetic framing.

_2.2.3.2.      One of the alchemy related objects._
**[Screenshot of alchemy related object]**

_2.2.4.        Medieval worldview._
_2.2.4.1.      Philosophy/astronomy etc._
The medieval worldview expressed by these objects includes the medieval understanding of potentially airborne disease, medieval cosmology, and the structure of religion in society, which the description for the rosary object describes as **[...]**

_2.2.4.2.      Religion_
_2.2.4.2.1.    Churches_
The central presence of religion in the society depicted in *A Plague Tale* is frequently and subtly referenced. Multiple church structures are featured prominently at various points in the game, often at critical plot junctures. The church interiors, with basic stone statuary and side altars as well as simply painted interior domes, reflect a time when Christianity was more unified and objective. The churches could be Orthodox and in their stone austerity almost look Reformed, despite being solidly Western and Catholic in their historical context.

_2.2.4.2.2.    Good catholicism: Childlike faith_
_2.2.4.2.3.    Bad catholicism: The Inquisition_
Religion in the story appears starkly contrasted between the imperial, self-righteous zeal of the Inquisition and the innocent faith of Hugo and Amicia's prayers. One of the incredible aspects of the story is its deeply revertial nature, exhibited again in the way it respects organized religion. The common archetype of evil religion is absolutely and centrally present in the Inquisition and the main plot of the story, but as much as religion is depicted as a force of evil, the artifacts of religion in society are continually portrayed as a positive, a psychological defense for the poor children against their trauma. Churches throughout the game are portrayed as places of safety, refuges for the children's threatened innocence.
**¶**

_2.2.4.2.3.1.  Mention how the Inquisition is explicitly being called out as being "heresy and occultism" and not sanctioned by the Pope_
What's more, the story explicitly draws a distinction between authentic catholic Christianity and the religion of the Inquisition. At one point, a cutscene shows a bishop from the Church reporting on the Church's investigation of this Inquisition. The bishop says that the Inquisition was operated without the approval of the Pope and stated that he found only "heresy and occultism." No further argument or example needs to be given than this to convince theology nerds and Church history buffs that they should love *A Plague Tale*.

_2.2.4.3.      Alechemy_
_2.3.          Low fantasy elements_
Though highlighting religion as part of the background of the medieval world and as a force of both good and evil in the lives of the characters and institutions that inhabit it, it would be inaccurate to label *A Plague Tale* as a religious game, in the same way, for example, that the 2008 indie title *That Dragon Cancer* about a Christian family's struggle is. Instead, *A Plague Tale* reverberates with a sense of profound but subtle spirituality entwined with the religious realism of the historical worldview. This extroverts what archetypal medieval fantasy, especially in the epic scale of *The Lord of the Rings*, internalizes. Where the traditional high fantasy constructs mythologies to objectify the values and lifestyles from traditional culture -- and often in particular from medieval Europe -- *A Plague Tale* clothes the culturally authentic life infused by the sacred and the fantastic in small personal story using the grand framework of real-world history for its legendarium.
**¶**

That is the reason that *A Plague Tale* is also a fantasy. Asobo seems to shy away from the genre label, preferring to promote it as historical drama. They are certainly justified in doing so, as nothing in the world as presented would be far outside the expectations of reality from the characters' medieval worldview. However, the story's grand-scale mysticism incarnated within a real and historical setting achieves the conditions of low fantasy. Alchemy unites the legend with the gameplay itself and with the greater plot. The almechical and gnostic paraphernalia found littering out-of-the-way parts of the game maps, the references to generational mystique united to real-world history, these offer up the leftover remains of the great spiritual forces of epic myth after they have passed into our historical experience.

_3.            Narratology_
_3.1.          Plot teaser hinging on alchemy narrative/background_
Alchemy informs not only the genre associations but frames the story, as Lord and Lady De Rune, parents to Amicia and Hugo, are, in fact, alchemists. The De Rune family is inevitably bound up with the powers behind the Black Death. Their immediate journey, as they react to the consequences of their family's place in the backstory mythos, is more personal plot that might have been a historical thriller had it been in a novel instead of a videogame.

_3.1.1.        Description of plot as something beyond the player's experience (not directly related to what the player has to do)_
_3.2.          Introduction of the significance of the narrative side of the game in context of other media_
In the end, the personal story is terminated abruptly without much of the structure and characterization that would have to be present in a novel, while the mythic backstory is little more than teased. Even though the game won multiple awards for narrative, its brilliance in narrative design isn't strictly in the intricacies of the actual narrative, but in the design of the narrative experience of interacting with the story and the world in the course of a linear play-through.
