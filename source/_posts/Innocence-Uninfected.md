The year 2019 saw the outbreak of disease leading to widespread social unrest in Europe.

I'm referring to the milieu of *A Plague Tale: Innocence*, last year's winner of the Steam Award for the best story-rich game. Set in 1348, *A Plague Tale* shows life in medieval France progressively upended by the effects of the great pandemic that, historically, had arrived in Europe one year before. The fact that this artistic videogame was released almost exactly one year before the widespread lockdowns due to COVID-19 is so remarkable that players experiencing its survival horror narrative for the first time in 2020 are afforded a medievalized avatar of their daily zeitgeist. Not to say that playing the game was any less rewarding in 2019, I had rejoiced to find the vibe of pro-cultural folklore told to me by the voices and the courageous deeds of characters who vindicate the compromised struggle for heritage. The streamlined gameplay emphasizes mastery over victimization as the artistic yet photo-real aesthetic conveys the craftsy medieval ambience lying at the unity of the game's low fantasy narrative and its nerd-level historical detail. Never light but also never cynical, the game earns the emotional resonance of the epic through its twin dichotomies of a realistically dark story told from the perspective of a children's fantasy and of a traditionally fun gameplay experience created by an art-centric, character driven game design that excels with the streamlined focus of other award winning indie titles such as the 2012 PlayStation game *Journey*. Bridging the chasm between broken adulthood and the pure intensity of childhood, this game reawakens in players the desire to play.

Before we construe the appeal of this adorable and tragic game, let us consider its origin in the very country that serves as is it's setting, with the French videogame company Asobo Studio. Then, we can consider *A Plague Tale*'s relevance to our immediate context in comparison with the game's narrative milieu, set at the start of the 14th century's lethal pandemic. That will grant a useful platform for discussing the game's striking portrayal of medieval institutions in its fantasy inflected story. This simple videogame story pulls together place and time to simulate the perseverance of the just exemplified by its empathetic characters.

  Priorities:
      - Narrative awards -> Asobo -> characters -> Coronavirus/social media
      - History -> The Plague -> historicity -> fantasy
      - Atmosphere -> churches -> religion
      - Inquisition -> Catholicism -> history

From castle ramparts to church naves to desiccated battlefields, *A Plague Tale* lifts us up out of ordinary life to appreciate

Recognized for narrative achievement in multiple rankings, *A Plague Tale* incarnates the spirit of medieval European values in a realistic and artistically portrayed environment that expresses the purity of childhood ingenuity pitted against the horror of corruption exemplified by the rat infestation associated with the Black Death of the 14th century. Never light but also never cynical, the game takes players through a muted but also stark territory where recorded history overlaps with legend and with fantasy. Gameplay reliant on stealth mechanics causes players to experience the vulnerability of its protagonists, a teen girl with a slingshot and her epileptic younger brother, while sweeping them through ancestral castles and austere churches and arcane labyrinths on Windows PC and PlayStation. Unique in its combination of setting, gameplay mechanic, and tone, *A Plague Tale*'s emotional resonance comes from the way its own subjective character perseveres in the feeling of innocence as it narrates the perseverence of the just.

We owe this masterpiece to Asobo Studio, a videogame development company from France whose other major project is a flight simulator software in collaboration with Microsoft. Self-described on their Facebook [page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/asobostudio/about/) as a self-sufficient independent studio of about 150 employees, both the company and its flagship project stradle the traditional dichotomy in the gaming realm of between the mainstream industry dominated by giant corporations with their armies of enslaved creators and indie teams of college buddies with much ambition and little sleep. Enter *A Plague Tale*, which applies a world model in third-person over-the-shoulder perspective that feels standard enough and expensive enough for a AAA experience, while the limited range of motion in the action mechanics and the disciplined efficiency in the implementation of a constrained number of secondary features together with the attention to artistry evidences an indie ethos.

As a videogame, *A Plague Tale* integrates a few ludological elements to create linear progression through a series of game maps corresponding to the narrative chapters. The gameplay genre is definitively [stealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_game), such that real-time action involves navigating the world model without alerting hostiles, from whom the player character can run (though trying to outrun the enemy soldiers is rarely a successful strategy) but against whom she cannot stand and fight. When a hostile catches Amicia **[NOTE: menion her name previously or work her name into this paragraph]**, a cutscene shows her brutal death, and the session reverts to the last checkpoint. Players will watch Amicia die pitifully many times during a successful playthrough. One particularly successful bossfight or threshhold-guardian type encounter modifies [...] The endgame also incorporates an extended bossfight scenario involving precise timing and resource management, demonstrating that despite the narrative nature of the experience, gaming mechanics in their simplest forms are still a core part of what *A Plague Tale* embodies and delivers.

It feels experimental, though it could also never be called *avant-garde*.

 If that medieval worldview may be depicted without the extra-cultural judgment that might be expected in the twenty-first century, it is at least manifest that this beautiful game provoke
