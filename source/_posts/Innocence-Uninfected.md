The year 2019 saw the outbreak of disease leading to widespread social unrest in Europe.

I'm referring to the milieu of *A Plague Tale: Innocence*, last year's winner of the Steam Award for the best story-rich game. Recognized for narrative achievement in multiple rankings, *A Plague Tale* incarnates the spirit of medieval European values in a realistic and artistically portrayed environment that expresses the purity of childhood ingenuity pitted against the horror of corruption exemplified by the rat infestation associated with the Black Death of the 14th century. Never light but also never cynical, the game takes players through a muted but also stark territory where recorded history overlaps with legend and with fantasy. Gameplay reliant on stealth mechanics causes players to experience the vulnerability of its protagonists, a teen girl with a slingshot and her epileptic younger brother, while sweeping them through ancestral castles and austere churches and arcane labyrinths on Windows PC and PlayStation. Unique in its combination of setting, gameplay mechanic, and tone, *A Plague Tale*'s emotional resonance comes from the way its own subjective character perseveres in the feeling of innocence as it narrates the perseverence of the just.

Asobo -> languages -> France

Story/characters "For it is also in France"

 If that medieval worldview may be depicted without the extra-cultural judgment that might be expected in the twenty-first century, it is at least manifest that this beautiful game provoke
