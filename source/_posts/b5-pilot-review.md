This brew is neither altogether dark and strong and bitter, nor can its flavor be described as light or weak. Instead, this brew is full and deep but not very fine. If in 2018 the draught may taste a bit stale, the critic needs only consider the farflung ingredients in order to appreciate the enriching impact of the whole blend.
