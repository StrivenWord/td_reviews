Twenty five years have elapsed for us since the sadly nostalgic, winebibbing Londo Mollari first announced the dawn of the Third Age. In doing so, the ambassador teased the sincerely though bombastically portrayed concepts that combined uniquely within *Babylon 5* to brew the most relevant contemporary myth-parable fully native to pop culture entertainment.

This brew is neither altogether dark and strong and bitter, nor can its flavor be described as light or weak. Instead, this brew is full and deep but not very fine. If in 2018 the draught may taste a bit stale, the critic needs only consider the farflung ingredients in order to appreciate the enriching impact of the whole blend.

Immediately from the title narration delivered in character by Londo's actor Peter Jurasik, *The Gathering* accumulates stylistic beats from widely disparate taxonomies of themes.

We hear about the "Third Age," using the convention of sequential ages demarcated by cataclysmic events found in multiple epic fantasy franchises. *The Lord of the Rings* is set in its universe's Third Age, and *Babylon 5*'s creator J. Michael Straczynski is not the only author to have used similar nomenclature to evoke the dramatic grandeur and archetypal imagery that have grown beyond the genre boundary of high mythological fantasy. Tolkien's influence is yet to be revealed in its strongest manifestations, but here in the pilot film we are already staring backward at the legacies of decadent civilizations and hearing the evening lament of ancient races diminishing into the twilight as younger kindreds with incompatible destinies rise to replace them.

But though steeped in the literary imagery of the fantasy epic, *Babylon 5* falls fully within the science fiction family. It is not a science fantasy after the fashion of *Star Wars*. Though the language of epic fantasy is used in the title narration, the fact that Earth in the year 2257 is just now beginning *Babylon 5*'s Third Age suggests which side of the scale the series is inherently weighted toward. Instead of being set at the end of a long Age, striving to prevent a great foreordained apocalypse or working toward a great enlightenment, *The Gathering* is set on the inside of a threshhold. All the strife and drama leading up to this threshhold compose the movie's backstory, but the emphasis of both tone and story is from the outset optimistic and progressive. Unlike *Star Trek*, *Babylon 5* does not identify progress with utopianism or materialism. The way that the series will balance its centrality of humanity as a work of progressive science fiction with its high mythological sense of transcendental destiny remains to be seen.

As science fiction, *The Gathering* lays out some of the ecclectic qualities that that make *Babylon 5* impossible to measure on the "hard" to "soft" scale of scientific accuracy and realistic future possibility. However, *The Gathering* perhaps shows off the franchise's *harder* side more, leaving the more mystical elements to be intertwined with the science by coming episodes to be suggested by the mythological imagery. The one explictly *soft* element highlighted by *The Gathering*. The existence and social prevalence of human telepaths is easily the most difficult aspect of the setting to buy into, and here they easily play into the pervasive comic book vibe. But the aesthetic is not only composed of that "campy" self-conscious energy; it is also made up of an advanced realism informed by the harder sci-fi elements. Artificial gravity is produced by the centrifugal force generated by rotating sections of the station, and humans have to wear gas masks in order to pass through areas of the station prepared for creatures that breathe air of alien composition. Where *Star Trek* plays fast and loose with the concept of futuristic technology and relies on "technobabble" for a veneer of fake detail designed to conceal the fact that the technology has no substance, *Babylon 5* takes the higher ground of carefully portraying the interactions between technology and the characters and setting, using technobabble inconspicuously and sparingly.

The tactfully employed technobabble implicates another science fiction sub-genre that stands alongside space opera as a major classification for *Babylon 5* and *The Gathering* -- cyberpunk, the genre of fictional gadgetry and imaginative interfacing between people and machines. *The Gathering* portrays bio-implanted weaponry and a personal espionage device, one appearing in a momentary surfacing of the cyberpunk vein, the other serving a critical part of the plot and bridging the deeper aspects of the backstory and world with the political story sub-plot.

The feeling associated with the cyberpunk elements is also built up by the appearance and operation of the common everyday technologies that the characters use. *The Gathering* features identification cards that interface with terminals to display the carrier's identifying information. That one realistic application of understandable technologies lends a sense of timelessness. Something like it could have been implemented in 1993; today in 2018 we almost expect it to exist.

Not only is the concept of the identicards understandable, but the design of the terminal display -- shown prominently as a plot and character development device -- has aged remarkably well, the font reminiscient of alarm clock numerals notwithstanding. Granted, the DOS-like output looks timelessly old (though we've seen the return of the command line to the popular consciousness in the past ten years or so), and at any rate other tech seen in *The Gathering* now looks definitively retro -- curved CRT monitors, for a chief example. This is a *retro* old, an outdatedness that blends with the decade reflecting hairstyles and the oldschool geek spaceships and control consoles and campy sci-fi miscellany. The special effects have aged at least as poorly as the CRT monitors, with the computer rendered exterior space frames and the title graphics being glaringly crude and surreal today. 

Perhaps we can't definitively identifying which parts of the retro aesthetic were once inherent and which are only now so interpreted. Like a familiar pair of leather boots or a baseball mitt, the campy retro aesthetic has worn in over time. Contemporary audience members already familiar either with genre conventions or with the now popular 80's revivalism should be able to view *The Gathering* as the earnest mythological story that it is without its seriousness being compromized by its aesthetic.

The retro aesthetic combines with the cyberpunk to craft the setting into a bridge that unites the viewers' present world with the mystery and adventure found in the genre elements. Naturally, cyberpunk is the science fiction sub-genre that we recognize from everyday life in our 21st century. The sub-genre best serves not as a projection of possible tomorrows but as an actualization of potential todays. In *The Gathering*, the espionage plot serves alongside background dialog to deliver what will become one of the primary story elements of *Babylon 5* -- politics. Twentieth century political narratives are both explictly named and referenced. There is both a direct continuity to the modern histories that we remember in the show's backstory chronology and strongly implied parallels between the sociopolitical situation between the galactic civilizations and the Cold War era politics during which *The Gathering* was created.

{ -- use cyberpunk as real life to transition into politics -- }

The setting exudes a contemporary realism. Partly created by the harder science fiction elements and by the characters' detailed interactions with their environments, the realism is also conveyed through the politics that forms an important part of the background of *The Gathering*'s larger story. Political plotlines will yet come into their own, but in *The Gathering* the

It feels like a real world, and it feels like *our* world. (Of course, the point of using the trappings of space opera is that it isn't only one boring little world, it's a cosmos full of many worlds. This escape from boring boring boring that still feels normal normal........)

now in 2018 as in "Earth year" 2257 of the pilot's setting

{ telepaths as social revolution }


{ define "pervasive comic book vibe" }

{ But it's a place -- biblical sounding -- }

{ It would be wrong to say that scifi setting and mythology theme is the most important thing about B5/Gathering --     CHARACTERS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TOOOOOOO }
