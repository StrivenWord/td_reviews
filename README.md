This is the repository for a personal review blog, written and implemented by Paul Lee, d/b/a The Striven Word.

# Implementation

The codebase for this project is [Hexo](https://hexo.io), a static site generator and blogging platform licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Hexo is used as distributed through the Node Package Manager, and was at version 3.6.0 at the time of this repository's first commit.

The Hexo theme Landscape, the default theme in Hexo version 3.6, is also used. The Landscape is likewise released under the MIT license.

# Theming

Some of the aesthetic design of the blog, structural layout, and user functionality comes from the Landscape theme. The theme has been modified and is referred to by a different identifier -- *drearylands* -- in this repository.

# Content

With the possible exception of small fragments of text that are part of the theme design and the definite expception of the content of the sole file *source/_posts/hello-world.md*, all text in this repository is the original creation of Paul Lee. The blog posts are represented by markdown files in the *source/_posts* directory.
